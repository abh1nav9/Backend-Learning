## Modules

- Learned how to structure Node.js applications using modules.
- Explored the use of `require` and `module.exports` to import and export modules.

## File Handling

- Gained experience in reading, writing, and manipulating files using the `fs` module.
- Implemented asynchronous and synchronous file operations.

## Node.js Working

- Understood the core concepts of Node.js, including the event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O.
- Explored the Node.js runtime and its components like the event loop, callbacks, and streams.

## HTTP Methods

- Studied various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) and their use cases in building RESTful APIs.
- Implemented CRUD operations using these methods.

## URL Architecture

- Learned about URL structures, query parameters, and path variables.
- Implemented route handling in Express.js based on different URL patterns.

## Versioning

- Explored API versioning strategies to maintain backward compatibility.
- Implemented versioning in API routes.

## Express.js

- Built server-side applications using the Express.js framework.
- Implemented middleware, routing, and error handling in Express.

## REST API

- Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
- Followed REST principles for designing resource-based APIs.

## Postman API Testing

- Used Postman to test API endpoints.
- Explored features like collections, environments, and automated testing in Postman.

## HTTP Headers

- Understood the purpose of HTTP headers in requests and responses.
- Worked with headers for content negotiation, authentication, and more.

## MongoDB

- Learned the basics of MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
- Performed CRUD operations using the MongoDB shell and MongoDB Compass.

## Mongoose

- Used Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, to interact with the database.
- Defined schemas, models, and performed database operations using Mongoose.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

- Implemented Server Side Rendering to deliver dynamic content from the server.
- Explored the benefits of SSR in terms of SEO and performance.

## EJS

- Used Embedded JavaScript (EJS) as a templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML on the server.
- Passed data from the server to views and displayed it using EJS.

## Authentication

- Implemented user authentication using Express.js and various authentication strategies.
- Worked with hashing techniques and third-party authentication services.

## JWT

- Used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication in APIs.
- Implemented JWT-based login and protected routes in an application.

## Authorization

- Understood the difference between authentication and authorization.
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources.

## Cookies and Sessions

- Worked with cookies and sessions to manage user state across HTTP requests.
- Implemented session management using Express-session and cookies.
